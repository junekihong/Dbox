Server
Written in python.
Uses two third-party libraries (aside from the standard python library):
-Tornado (Web server)
-Curtain (Digest auth for Tornado, slightly modified by us to fix a couple of bugs)
Both are included to make distribution easier.

To run: ./server.py
-p can be used to specify the port
-w can be used to specify an alternate webroot
